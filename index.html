        <p>I'm an avid gamer with a relentless drive to improve my creative prowess. It was this passion for gaming and technology that set me on a course into the world of programming.</p>

        <p>In 2020, I took a significant step forward by enrolling in UCLA's Coding Bootcamp. By 2021, I proudly finished the cohort specialized and armed with a solid foundation in Full Stack development.</p>

        <p>Since then, I've remained unwavering in my commitment to self-improvement, continuously enhancing my skills through:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Udemy Courses</li>
          <li>Self-Study (Personal Projects, freeCodeCamp, etc)</li>
          <li>Seizing Freelancing Opportunities.</li>

        <h2 class="text-dark bg-primary p-2 display-inline-block rounded-edges1 box-shadow1 px-3 mb-3"><i class="fas fa-tools"></i> Skills</h2>
        <p>My journey in programming has been marked by an unwavering commitment to continuous learning and skill enhancement. Since successfully completing my course, I've passionately pursued opportunities to broaden my expertise. Through dedicated effort and a relentless pursuit of knowledge, I've had the privilege of creating and contributing to an extensive portfolio of over a dozen projects.</p>
        <p>These projects not only demonstrate my technical prowess but also serve as a testament to my dedication to mastering the craft. From developing solutions on issues to tackling complex challenges, I take pride in each of my project's evolution and the invaluable experience gained along the way.</p>
        <p>My commitment to advancing my skillset remains resolute, and I eagerly anticipate the ever-evolving landscape of technology as I continue to push the boundaries of what's possible to me.</p>
        <p><b>Here's an interesting tidbit:</b> The <i>very</i> portfolio you're currently exploring was crafted using a custom generator and template that I designed and developed myself! While the foundation comes from PortfolioForge, I've also made extensive edits and customizations to make it unique and hopefully inspire others to further personalize their own portfolios. It's the first featured project further down.</p>
