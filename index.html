        <p>I'm an avid gamer with a relentless drive to improve my creative prowess. My passion for gaming and tech paved the way for my journey into programming. It all began when I realized that creating virtual worlds and solving complex problems in game engines shared a common thread with web development.</p>

        <p>In 2020, I took a significant step by enrolling in UCLA's Coding Bootcamp. By 2021, I proudly completed the bootcamp, specializing in Full Stack Web Development. During this transformative journey, I immersed myself in the world of coding, working on languages like JavaScript and subsequently Node.js, utilizing CDNs like Bootstrap and Bulma, diving into frameworks like React, honing my database management skills with SQL and SQLite.</p>

        <p>During this time, I found that my gaming experience prepared me for this field, in a roundabout sort of way. I've grown this perspective on problem-solving; it's similar to tackling puzzles in games like Portal - a persistence to try and get an outcome.</p>

        <p>My growth as a developer has been marked by an unwavering commitment to continuous learning and strengthening my skills. Since completing the bootcamp, I've pursued every opportunity to broaden my expertise. Through dedicated effort, I've had the privilege of creating and contributing to an extensive array of over a dozen projects.</p>

        <p>I take immense pride in my growth as a developer. Each project's evolution reminds me of the invaluable experience I've gained along the way. My commitment to improvement is resolute, and I'm enthusiastic about pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</p>

        
        <p>I've got two ambitions:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Software Developer:</b> I aspire to be a professional software developer. The goal is to work for a forward-thinking company, working towards a more interactive and dynamic digital environment.</li>

          <li><b>Game Developer:</b> I aspire to craft captivating video games that people can immerse themselves in and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Feel free to explore my projects and skills to learn more about my journey.</p>

        <p>My journey in programming has been marked by an unwavering commitment to continuous learning and skill enhancement. Since successfully completing my course, I've passionately pursued opportunities to broaden my expertise. Through dedicated effort and a relentless pursuit of knowledge, I've had the privilege of creating and contributing to an extensive portfolio of over a dozen projects.</p>
        <p>These projects not only demonstrate my technical prowess but also serve as a testament to my dedication to mastering the craft. From developing solutions on issues to tackling complex challenges, I take pride in each of my project's evolution and the invaluable experience gained along the way.</p>
        <p>My commitment to advancing my skillset remains resolute, and I eagerly anticipate the ever-evolving landscape of technology as I continue to push the boundaries of what's possible to me.</p>
        <p><b>Here's an interesting tidbit:</b> The <i>very</i> portfolio you're currently exploring was crafted using a custom generator and template that I designed and developed myself! While the foundation comes from PortfolioForge, I've also made extensive edits and customizations to make it unique and hopefully inspire others to further personalize their own portfolios. It's the first featured project further down.</p>
