            <p>I'm an avid gamer with a relentless drive to improve my creative prowess. My passion for gaming and tech paved the way for my journey into programming. It all began when I realized that creating virtual worlds and solving complex problems in game engines shared a common thread with web development.</p>

            <p>I've found that the time I've spent gaming has prepared me for this field, in a roundabout sort of way. I've grown this perspective on problem-solving; it's similar to tackling puzzles in games like Portal - a persistence to try and get an outcome.</p>

            <p>My growth as a developer has been marked by an unwavering commitment to continuous learning and strengthening my skills. Through dedicated effort, I've had the privilege of creating and contributing to an extensive array of over a dozen projects.</p>

            <p>I take immense pride in my growth as a developer. Each project's evolution reminds me of the invaluable experience I've gained along the way. My commitment to improvement is resolute, and I'm enthusiastic about pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</p>

            <p>I've got two ambitions:</p>

            <ol>
              <li><b>Software Developer:</b> I aspire to be a professional software developer. The goal is to work for a forward-thinking company, working towards a more interactive and dynamic digital environment.</li>

              <li><b>Game Developer:</b> I aspire to craft captivating video games that people can immerse themselves in and enjoy.</li>
