## :wave: Description

### 😁 Welcome to my portfolio page! 
I've built this portfolio to highlight both my journey and growth as a web-developer while also at its core, showcase the power of adaptability using a template provided by my open-source initiative, PortfolioForge.

### ❓ What is PortfolioForge & Why This Portfolio Matters
PortfolioForge was built to empower developers and professionals to craft their own unique web profiles. Creating a ready-to-use portfolio or a developer-friendly baseline.  My purpose for PortfolioForge is help spark the idea that you can create a unique online portfolio, whether or not you choose to use PortfolioForge. 

This repository serves as a live example of how PortfolioForge can be leveraged to create a web profile that reflects your unique style and personality. By personalizing this template, I hope to inspire others to embark on their own journey of customization and make their portfolios truly their own. While at the same time featuring my own portfolio that I use professionally. 

### 💹 Explore My Journey
As you navigate through this portfolio, you'll witness a curated collection of my projects, each representing a step in my development journey. From coding bootcamps to self-study and freelancing, this portfolio encapsulates the evolution of my skills and dedication to improvement.

### 💭 Developer Notes
Developing this portfolio has been a learning process itself, throughout this creative journey I've drawn out wireframes and researched effective portfolio's to generate an idea of what I'd like to create myself. The website itself has grown exponentially in part because of suggestions from professionals and friends, resulting in what I believe is a solid portfolio that I can use currently and build upon for the future. 

One of the trickiest parts about this portfolio was setting up the featured projects. The first version of the design was using up a lot of memory, so I:
- Created still images of each project
- Created gifs that feature project usage
- Set each image and gif to lazy-loading
- Used JavaScript to:
  - Preload GIFs
  - Keep GIF's paused until mouseenter
  - Reset GIF's when card's hovered off
  - Leverage Observer API to play animations when users observe specific sections
 
Eventually I'll make major changes focused on the UX/UI aspect of the project. Additionally I have plans on upgrading this profile to utilize React. Keep an eye out, this portfolio will surely go through different iterations!

### 🙏 Thank You
Above all, thank you for stopping by and exploring my portfolio! I genuinely hope that you find inspiration here to fuel your own future portfolio projects. Your visit means the world to me, and I'm excited for your creative journey.🌟
